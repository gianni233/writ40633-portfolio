# Week 2 Reflection and Self-Assessment

## 1. Confidence Check
After two weeks in WRIT40363, I feel more confident with HTML and using VS Code. I am comfortable setting up a proper project structure, creating semantic HTML documents, and organizing files efficiently. I still want to improve on applying more advanced accessibility practices consistently.

## 2. Learning Curve
Learning Git and GitHub was eye-opening. I was surprised by how much version control helps manage changes and track progress. Initially, understanding the clone → edit → commit → push workflow felt tricky, but after practicing, it became much more intuitive.

## 3. Problem-Solving Growth
When I encountered issues, such as code not rendering correctly or pushing commits incorrectly, I approached solving them by reviewing tutorials, checking my file structure, and experimenting step by step. Compared to Week 1, I now feel more patient and methodical in debugging problems.

## 4. Professional Mindset
Transitioning from “just making web pages” to developing professionally with semantic HTML and proper version control has been exciting. I appreciate how structured development improves clarity and maintainability. I am motivated by the idea of creating websites that are both accessible and professional.

## 5. Week 2 Reflection
My biggest "wow moment" this week was understanding how semantic HTML elements connect with the box model and page structure. Seeing how proper organization in code directly affects accessibility and readability finally clicked for me.

## 6. Looking Forward
I am most curious about learning CSS styling in depth and how to make my pages visually appealing while maintaining semantic structure. I am also a bit nervous about more complex Git workflows, but I am eager to keep improving.

## 7. Support and Resources
The most helpful resources so far have been hands-on practice in VS Code, the step-by-step lab instructions, and observing examples of semantic HTML structure. Going forward, I might need additional guidance on advanced accessibility features and more complex Git commands. I Think i should also come to more office hours.
