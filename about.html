      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>Hello! My name is <strong>Gianni Henry</strong>. I’m 22 years old and originally from Kingston, Jamaica.

      and I also have a minor in <strong>Data Analysis</strong>. I am passionate about understanding economic systems 
      and applying data-driven methods to solve real-world problems. My future goal is to pursue a master’s degree

      <h2>My Goals</h2>
      <p>In this course, I hope to strengthen my understanding of HTML, CSS, and web development.

      interests in data analysis.</p>
